# Lost In Translation

This project is a React Application (front) for translating text into sign language represented as images. The application uses an external API/backend for CRUD operations (save and retrieve users/translation history).

## 1) Startup / Login page
Login page where the user can sign in with a username (no password). Logged in users are redirected to the Translation page.

## 2) Translation page
Main page of the app, available for users that are logged in. The user types text into the input box. "Translate"-button translates the text into sign language.

## 3) Profile page
The profile page displays the translation history of the user (max 10 translations). The history can be cleared with a button. User can also log out to clear the session storage.
